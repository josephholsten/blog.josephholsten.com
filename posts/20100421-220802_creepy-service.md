Title: Walgreens:

If I penned “I'm Joseph. Thank you for allowing me to serve you today.” onto a handwritten receipt for a client, it would be super creepy. That you write it in cheap register monospace on every single receipt doesn't make it cool. It's just soulless, institutionalized super creepy.
