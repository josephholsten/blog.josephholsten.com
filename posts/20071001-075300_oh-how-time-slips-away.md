Title: Oh how time slips away

I've been a user of [Harvest][] for a number of months now. I've gotten
a few people on it, and enjoy it thoroughly. I've tried Tick, but a time
tracker without a timer is (grasping for metaphor) worthless (clear
language is better than colorful ambiguity, right?).

However, I've just given [SlimTimer][] a try and am unsure of harvest's
future. Basecamp integration is awesome, yes. But do I have to have
project constraints on my users? Estimates? No.

Of course, I could convince my employer to adopt harvest. Their time
tracker is a horrible mess, but build with the same goal in mind.
Estimates, employees constrained to a finite set of projects, spiffy
API.

I will ponder this problem for perhaps the next month, since I just
payed the harvest bill. We'll see.
