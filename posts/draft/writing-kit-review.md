If you liked Dr Drang's reviews of iOS text editors, there's a new contender that you ought to check out: [Writing Kit](http://getwritingkit.com/).

Of course, it has the obligatory Dropbox and TextExpander support. But it goes much further, it can take you through your entire writing process. If you make things in the typical [New Jersey approach](http://dreamsongs.com/WIB.html), you know to make it work, then make it right, then make it great. And make it live as soon as possible.

For making it work, it has a custom keyboard that 
- Markdown love with a custom keyboard and selection actions to do things like add a header, bold, link, &c.
- Markdown preview, plus *outline mode from document headers*
- Export Markdown or HTML to clipboard, email, tumblr, twitter and other services

Something Special
- Quick research pane to look up any word in Terminology or DuckDuckGo
- Browser with DuckBar (gets you DuckDuckGo goodies (math, facts, &c) and bang (!) shorthand for loads of site-specific searches)
- Text-only browsing mode
- Reading queue, either local or Instapaper
- Bookmarks, either local or Delicious or Pinboard
- Tag suggestions from Delicious or Pinboard

Point being: everything you do in Writing Kit can be cloudified: Dropbox files, Instapaper queue,  Pinboard bookmarks.



Link whichever dropbox folder you like
Fonts: decent selection

## Suggestions:

### Annoyances

The margin around the text area doesn't work for scrolling the text. 

The header button doesn't like it when you press it multiple times in a row. Maybe there is another way to add a subsection heading, but this shouldn't select the extra characters on the next line. 


### Editing 
Replace the T icon with a standard i circle, place it on the far left. On there, you should be able to change file name, font, and see word count.

Replace the drawer icon in the upper left with a back arrow like Elements, or use a standard back tab with the word 'Files'. Replace this with a blue done button in edit mode. This will allow you to remove the hide keyboard icon from the keyboard.

Use Nebulous Note style full screen mode, with touch-to-edit and hide keyboard.

Merge the browser and the quick research modes. Leave 

Use the modified keyboard style of Panic's Prompt.

### Document List
Pulling downing in the document list should show a search box

Remove the "Unlink Dropbox" button from the bottom, put that in settings.

Remove the "Done" button, since the last edited document is at the top of the list, the user can just select the document by name. 

Put the new document button on the top right, use a + icon, as in the notes app.

Swipe to delete should show a blue Cancel button in the upper right, signaling you want to cancel the delete, as in the notes app.

Some missing features:
- full screen mode
- file name searching

- sorting (modification date only)
- word count
- per file fonts
