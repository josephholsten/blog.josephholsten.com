I used to have a hell of a time interacting with people. I didn't really feel like I understood them, so I basically just interacted with everyone like they were robots. Say just enough information, as clearly as possible, to get them to understand me. Pathos be damned. I can't tell you if this worked very well because, like I said, I didn't understand people well enough to even realize if I was grating or boring or interesting at all. All I ever hoped for was to be clear.

But eventually I switched schools and then went to college and I learned that good ideas clearly expressed aren't enough to really move people the way I wanted. There's more to people than just saying what you want. Than saying what they should do for you. Even being clear about why they should do it doesn't mean they'll like it. And at some point I realized I figured it would be nice if people actually liked me.

One of the worst things I used to do was make people feel stupid. It's pretty easy to be demeaning when you're trying hard to be clear.

I recently met a guy who had this problem with his boss when he was new on the job. One time he was working on a bit of complicated paperwork that his boss would have approve. He just knew that, even though he'd thought through all the fiddly bits that made this agreement he was working on so complicated, if he just went to her and dropped it on her desk, she'd spend the next five minutes second guessing him and making them both frustrated. So he went to her and said that there were some things he wasn't sure how to finish. She took her time helping him fill out the agreement, and every so often he'd pitch in asking if he understood a complicated bit here or there, sometimes catching her mistakes. It took about as long as it would have had he just taken the finished paperwork to her and defended it to her. By the time they were done, she was satisfied and felt like she'd helped the new guy understand the business. But while he was about to walk out, he happened to slip and she saw the agreement he'd filled out just before going to her, all the complicated bits worked out in advance. And as he left her office, she looked at him, both embarrassed and proud, in a way that said, "Wow, you just handled me." And they'd share an inside joke about it any time he asked her for her opinion afterward.

Since I had no idea how to actually go about learning to make people like me, I did what every painfully geeky internet denizen does. I asked around on Usenet. After an embarrassing period of lurking on alt.seduction.fast, I actually managed to find a few resources that could help me hidden between the pitches of hucksters and memoirs of sleaze-bags.

Since almost every woman I've met would kill for a guy who can make them laugh, it's not surprising that the most useful tips I got off the board were about how to actually develop a sense of humor so you can be funny on purpose. The advice to wear a feather boa and fuzzy pink pimp's hat never seemed quite as useful.

But those tips turned me onto a great book by Helitzer called [Comedy Writing Secrets][helitzer]. It's got more theory than you could shake a stick at, but what it really teaches is how to hack someone else's brain. Like any system, our brains depend on having a context set up for them to operate in. While we're operating in that context, there's only so many places our brains can move to. But like pushing shellcode through an overflow, it's possible to affect other contexts without our brain realizing it. If you learn to do that,  once you've set up the other context while keeping the brain distracted, all you have to do is jump to the other context and you get—surprise!

Recently I've been trying to stay on top of my friend's blog more, especially since the we went trough a bit of craziness moving it to the new hosting. I used to be better about keeping on top of it, but for a while there didn't seem to be much point. It's supposed to be a blog about the business, and when you're as much of a regular as I have been, you don't need status updates on what new product came in or who just got hired or what event is coming up. So I just stopped following.

But I've been reading my friend more and I couldn't help notice that the writing is really good now. It's not that it's got a human touch, he's always had that in every part of his business. It's that he's not just giving information now, he's telling stories.

Storytelling is one of those things every marketer says you should do with your work, but it's not something people actually are used to doing anymore. Hell, those same marketers are saying you should be on twitter and hardly anyone knows how to tell a story in that short of space. 

But storytelling is probably the biggest thing that keeps me handing money to the businesses I frequent. I'm crazy about paper catalog from [J. Peterman][jpeterman], even though their taste is pretty different from mine and I can hardly afford anything they offer. They don't even have photographs of their products, just drawn illustrations and simple descriptions. I keep going back to this japanese place [Yokozuna] not just because it's near where I work, but because they have the best fortune cookies. I got one that said, “Chuck Norris destroyed the periodic table, because he only recognizes the element of surprise.” And I know my next bag is coming from [Saddleback Leather][saddlebackleather], in no small part because of the answer to their [frequently asked question][saddlefaq], “The cool medallion hanging on your bags, where can I get one?” I'm really a sucker for a good story.

We originally set up this blog for my friend because he got a nasty letter from Starbucks claiming that they owned the word doubleshot. 




Ive got to write more stories.
