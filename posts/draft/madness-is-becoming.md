Title: madness is becoming, non?

god is how everything works. no one would argue with me when i say there
are rules by which matter and energy interact. whether you want to call
it physics or divine intent, the i plan on calling these rules god. deal
with it.

well these rules are not dissimilar to the rules of chess. it is
non-trivial to extrapolate all possible interactions from a single move.
conversely, with a complete rule set, a set of all possible games which
are valid chess could be created. in the same way, a complete list of
possible games could be abbreviated as the rule set of chess. the two
are simply different representations of each other.

this is strange. when one starts recording all the posible valid states
that qualify in a game of chess, one can induce rules. this is how
unknown systems are testedâ€”all the provably valid and invalid states are
compiled, and an attempt at a representative finite state machine is
abstracted. this machine consists of known particular states, and
general state-changes, or processes. often times, the process is
abstracted to apply to many unproven states, and will be useful in
application to many; however, eventually an initial state that was
assumed to gain application of a process fails to perfectly match the
anticipated final state.
