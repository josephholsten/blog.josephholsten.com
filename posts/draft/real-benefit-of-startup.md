what's ramen profitable if you're a successful consultant? 

It seems like there must be a great benefit but I can seem to figure out why. That bugs me. I really would like to run my own business but I'm having a hard time justifying it in he harsh light of day.

From a macroeconomic perspective, I seems like consultants would be way better. Consultants tend to get hired for what they are expert in, so 

The naiv argument would be based on the profit / value add per person. Since startups are much riskier, there is certainly a prisoners dilema
