Regarding [passion][].

There is not any "grand, magnificent, all-encompassing design" and there
never was or will be.

What looks grand and designed in hindsight is the just like seeing
design in the free market. There is no watchmaker. Just billions of
choices, good or bad.

So fuck the driving forces, and make a passionate choice now.
