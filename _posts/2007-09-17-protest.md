[Students Protest Campus-wide Ban][] Thank you Zach. It's too bad that
the issue is being made to be first amendment rights. I'd really love
o'colly focus on the real causes of cancer, the sun and cell phones. We
students are being bombarded by radiation from all sides and all the
administration wants to do is eliminate the tiny wisps of death-vapor
from cigarettes? How about eliminating the carbon monoxide spewing
petroleum engines from the student body's common property? Oh, right.
Because, like all administrative bodies, it's only out to excersise its
power. Flex a muscle, do some strength training, hit on the cute
personal trainer, then give the mathletes wedgies. All in a day's
responsibilities as ivory tower academic administrators. Shoot, why
doesn't anyone tell me when I slip into hyperbole mode?
