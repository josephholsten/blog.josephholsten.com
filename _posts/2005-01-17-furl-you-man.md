title: furl you man!
---

oh hey, i forgot to mention that i have stopped using furl. there is
nothing wrong with furl, but i found a complete replacement which has
additional features. this replacement is absolutely [del.icio.us][].

there are really very few features. obviously it can save a url, with a
title and description. instead of folders for organization, it has tags
like gmail. user collections are openly available, mine is at
[del.icio.us/pantosys][]. user collections filtered by tag are
available, for instance [del.icio.us/pantosys/comic][]. a collection of
all links with the same tag are available like this
[del.icio.us/tag/comic][]. the most popular links are available at
[del.icio.us/popular][]. finally, everything is available in both rss
and html representations. not quite as respresentational state transfer
would have it, but hey it is a start. and for firefox users, that is a
hell of a lot of live boookmarks.

it is late and early.
