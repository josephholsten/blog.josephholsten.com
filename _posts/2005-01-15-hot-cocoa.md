title: Hot Cocoa
---

this is my present recipe for hot cocoa

-   4 teaspoons cocoa powder
-   1 teaspoon brown sugar
-   0.25 liters milk

stir the dry ingredients and about a tablespoon of milk into a thick
syrup at room temperature. place on 140Ëš fahrenheit and stir in the rest
of the milk.

this recipe actually is not comparable to hot chocolate, but it is
simple and pretty tasty for a cheap alternative. i am going to get some
unsweetened chocolate this afternoon and whip up a recipe then.
