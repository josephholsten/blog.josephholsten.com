I've been down to step 7. It was terrifying for a while when I had no job, but manageable.

But there is no greater terror to me than losing what I had in that backpack. Most importantly, the phone and computer. Most of the space was occupied by clothes, but that bit of info kit was my life.

And still is. Is it really riding myself of the backpack when everything is still on Dropbox? Who am I if I do not have the tools I need to ply my trade? If I cannot communicate to the people who I care about?

Put generally, who am I without the ability to support those who support me?
