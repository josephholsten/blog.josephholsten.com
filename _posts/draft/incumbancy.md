Title: Incumbency: Symptom or Disease?

It seems that every conversation I have about politics mentions how many
incumbents are reelected. And yet, most of us feel that our legislatures
are ineffective at best. Seems like a concise problem, no?So what's
really wrong with incumbency? At first glance, it seems that we just
give our political the benefit of the doubt. [Better the devil you know
than the devil you don't, right?][] But there's also the fact that these
legislators tend to spend a great deal of their time getting reelected,
instead of passing reasonable legislation or removing the cruft.
