Title: Working for Morons

I know most programmers don't have to suffer with working for morons, so
here's a few of the things I have to put up with:

<dl>
<dt>
Unsupported tools
</dt>
<dd>
All of my current projects are built with open source tools, so when
there's a bug or missing feature I have to learn how to improve the tool
instead of paying strangers to understand our toolchain and process for
us.
</dd>
<dt>
Vague Job Roles
</dt>
<dd>
There's hardly any employees working for this client, so when I realize
there's work to be done I have to do it myself instead of delegating to
a separate department that has no insight into why solving the problem
is valuable
</dd>
<dt>
