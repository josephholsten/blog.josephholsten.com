Title: Getting into Open Government

Obama has written [two memoranda][] making it clear he intends to
encourage an open environment so the public can access the data it pays
to create. He wants to create an Open Government Directive to make that
happen. The [Office of Management and Budget][] is charged with
recommending what that should entail. And I have a few recommendations.

If the folks developing the semantic web want to make it happen, this is
the perfect opportunity. Whether you support [microformats][] or
[RDF][], the only way to really access this data is to get it marked up.
That means people need to get in there and dig around the data that is
being released. Draft profiles, sketch vocabularies, but if there is not
a way to mark up this data, it will not be done. If it does not happen
now, it will not be cleaned up before another administration.

There are some things that can happen immediately. Obama has released
[two executive orders][] already. It is great that he is doing work, but
here is an example of data that needs to get marked up:

> Section 1.  Definitions.  For purposes of this order:
>
> (a)  "Archivist" refers to the Archivist of the United States or his
> designee.
>
> (b)  "NARA" refers to the National Archives and Records
> Administration.
>
> (c)  "Presidential Records Act" refers to the Presidential Records
> Act, 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207.
>
> (d)  "NARA regulations" refers to the NARA regulations implementing
> the Presidential Records Act, 36 C.F.R. Part 1270.
>
> (e)  "Presidential records" refers to those documentary materials
> maintained by NARA pursuant to the Presidential Records Act, including
> Vice Presidential records.

See all those references to executive positions and legal statues? Every
last one of those should be a link. Each of these defined terms should
be entities in this document. When those terms are later used, they
should be links to the formal definition.

I am not saying it is President Obama's obligation to mark up legal
documents. But whoever is editing these drafts needs to have the tools
to make it easy. But what is the way to do this now? I do not know.
