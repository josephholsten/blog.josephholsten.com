title: Existential Risk Taxonomy
---

> We shall use the following four categories to classify existential
> risks:
>
> Bangs – Earth-originating intelligent life goes extinct in relatively
> sudden disaster resulting from either an accident or a deliberate act
> of destruction.
>
> Crunches – The potential of humankind to develop into posthumanity is
> permanently thwarted although human life continues in some form.
>
> Shrieks – Some form of posthumanity is attained but it is an extremely
> narrow band of what is possible and desirable.
>
> Whimpers – A posthuman civilization arises but evolves in a direction
> that leads gradually but irrevocably to either the complete
> disappearance of the things we value or to a state where those things
> are realized to only a minuscule degree of what could have been
> achieved.
