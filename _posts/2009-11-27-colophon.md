The display face is [Trebuchet MS][], designed by [Vincent Connare][].
The text face is Lucida Grande by Bigelow & Holmes.

Libera Ideoj is powered by Wordpress and hosted by Joyent. Both are
quite satisfactory for my needs. The [template][] is a derivitive of
[Simplr][], lovingly created in [vim][].
