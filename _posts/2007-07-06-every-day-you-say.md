title: Every Day, You Say?

I promise that for the next month, I will not have an unusual number of
rhyming titles. But titles there will be!

I stated this blog back when google first took a liking of it. Life has
changed a bit since then. I intend to occasionally note the interesting
changes, but more often mention interesting problems.

I am glad that you are so foolish as to read my archives.
