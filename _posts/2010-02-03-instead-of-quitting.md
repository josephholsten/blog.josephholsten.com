Title: Instead of Quitting

* I read [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20100204101212/http://addictionis.org/).
* I smoked.
* I started to cry.
* I started to argue.
* I poured another whiskey.
* I followed the links.
* I smoked another cigarette.
* I poured another whiskey.
* I started skype hoping my friend who goes to meetings was online.
* I got pissed off skype took so long to start.
* I got pissed off they weren't on.
* I thought about messaging them on facebook.
* I gave up.
* I followed more links.
* I smoked three more cigaretes.
* I poured another whiskey.
* I thought this wasn't worth posting.
* I gave up.
