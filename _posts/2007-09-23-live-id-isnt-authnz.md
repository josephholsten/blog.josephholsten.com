title: Live ID Isn't Auth[nz]

[Dare Obasanjo][] wrote about how [It isn’t OpenID vs. Windows Live
ID][]

If this <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr> is providing
authorization to access resources, wouldn’t that make it an
authentication and authorization
<abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr>?

People are confused because it’s called web authentication. That is what
OpenID does. It’s not necessarily a
<abbr title="Single Sign On">SSO</abbr> provider, as vidoop shows.
