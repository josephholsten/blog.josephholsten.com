title: But I strongly fear that among the 70,000 farmers tomorrow there will be no
  philosopher. If there is one—everything being possible—he will strike with only
  slightly less force than the others, for he will have read Darwin and will know
  the value of the fight for life. Like Daudet, he will find this a very interesting
  ‘struggle for existence’ to talk about.
