title: Selenium Testing
---

If you have ever had to do QA on your product, you can relate to the
nagging sense of dread whenever a manager walks past your door those
weeks. Or you hear the customer, who speaks loud enough the office can
all hear, explaining their latest error on speakerphone.

And unless you are brilliant, you've even had a problem in the second
round of testing that worked in the first place.

Or perhaps, you are a test driven developer, but every so often the
browser just does not want to care that your unit tests all pass.

If this is you, investigate selenium. Or hang around a while for a
proper series of mini tutorials
