Title: Damned Flickr

It must be very difficult to be a [Daring Fireball][]. Not only must he
suffer the indignity of being the world's foremost Apple fanboy and a
tragic follower of the Yankee franchise, recently he's had to endure a
[little purple cowlick][] infringing on brilliant design.

So with a few minor changes to Mr. [Knauss's snarky swipe at our dear
Yank][], I've taken a comb to that little logo.
