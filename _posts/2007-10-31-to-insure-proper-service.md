Gmail IMAP + Mail.app is nice. Note that you may select the gmail
*Drafts*, then go to Mailbox → Use This Mailbox For → Drafts, and so for
each gmail message. You may also archive a piece of mail in the inbox by
dragging it to *All Mail*. You may move another piece to to same place
with `Command + Option + T`.
