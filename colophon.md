Libera Ideoj is build on the works of many others.

It is powered by [Jekyll][] and hosted by [Github Pages][]. For a static blog, there's plenty of competition but very few can claim to be better.

The color scheme is based on [Solarized][] from [Ethan Schoonover][], using a heavily modified derivative of the [Solar][] template. I use the light mode for general text, and dark mode for code because us nerds do so love the dark.

The text face is [Source Sans][] from [Paul D. Hunt][]. I wanted a face that would stand up to large blocks of text, and while neo-grotesques are in vogue (see Roboto, San Fransisco and Segoe UI), I'm still partial to a humanist sans.
The monospace font is [Source Code][], also from Paul D. Hunt. Mostly this choice is to keep rhythm with body text when I use inline code. Whenever feasable, I'll be switching to [Hasklig][] from [Ian Tuomi][], a fork of Source Code with ligatures designed for programming texts.

The display face is [Overpass][] from [Delve Fonts][], inspired by the iconic Highway Gothic. While it's technically a neo-grotesque, its even stroke width and bobbed terminals keep it punchy compared to the universe of Helvetica clones.

When the odd serif face is needed, I follow the adage "When in doubt use Caslon", and so I use the modern revival [Libre Caslon][] from [Pablo Impallari][].

For drafting, I use [iA Writer][] to get ideas out of my head wherever I am. But all final editing is finished in [NeoVim][].

A previous incarnation used the display face [Trebuchet MS][], designed by [Vincent Connare][], best known for the most iconic typeface of the 1990s: Comic Sans.
The accompanying text face was [Lucida Grande][] by [Bigelow & Holmes][].
